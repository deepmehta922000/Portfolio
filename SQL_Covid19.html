										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This is a SQL data cleaning project that explores Covid-19 data. The project uses skills such as joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data types. It includes various SQL queries to retrieve data, such as total cases vs total deaths, total cases vs population, and countries with the highest infection rate compared to population. The project also breaks things down by continent and shows continents with the highest death count per population. Finally, the project uses temporary tables and views to store data for later visualizations.</p>

										<h2>Covid-19 Data Exploration Project: Detailed Explanation</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As the Covid-19 pandemic has affected our world in countless ways, I wanted to use my data analysis skills to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different countries and continents. To do so, I used a dataset that includes information about Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across the world.</p>
									<p>The dataset I used includes information such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population. I started by selecting the data for countries with known continents and then proceeded to explore different relationships between the variables.</p>
									<p>One of the first things I looked at was the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in a given country. I did this by calculating the death percentage for each country by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of cases. I then filtered the data to focus on countries with "states" in their names and sorted the results by country and date.</p>
									<p>Next, I explored the percentage of the population that had been infected with Covid-19 in different countries. To do this, I calculated the percentage of the population that had contracted Covid-19 by dividing the total number of cases by the population. I sorted the results by location and date and then looked at countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.</p>
									<p>After that, I looked at countries with the highest death counts per population. I calculated the total death count for each country by summing the total deaths column and then grouped the results by location. I then sorted the results by total death count in descending order.</p>
									<p>To gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different continents, I created a query that showed the continents with the highest death counts per population. I did this by grouping the data by continent and then calculating the total death count for each continent.</p>
									<p>To get a sense of the global impact of Covid-19, I calculated the total number of cases and deaths worldwide. I did this by summing the new cases and new deaths columns for all locations and dates in the dataset.</p>
									<p>Finally, I looked at the percentage of the population that had received at least one Covid-19 vaccine. To do this analysis, I utilized data on the total number of vaccine doses administered and the population size for each location and date. I calculated the percentage of the population that had received at least one dose of the vaccine by dividing the total number of doses administered by the population and then multiplying the result by 100. I then sorted the results by location and date to see how vaccination rates were progressing over time.</p>
									<p>Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on different countries and continents. I was able to identify trends and patterns in the data and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of different strategies for managing the pandemic.</p>
									<p>In conclusion, this project was an excellent opportunity for me to apply my data analysis skills to real-world problem. By exploring the Covid-19 data, I gained a greater understanding of the pandemic's impact on the world and the strategies used to manage it. I hope that my analysis can contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat the pandemic and improve public health.</p>
